## My Portfolio - React.js + Next.js Application

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio, a single-page application (SPA) built with React.js and Next.js. This project showcases my projects, skills, and contact information on a seamless, user-friendly interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The purpose of this application is to centralize and showcase my development projects while providing an appealing interface for visitors to learn more about me and my skills.

## ðŸš€ Features
Home Page : A custom design and smooth animation that enhance the user experience, both of which I created from scratch.

About : An introduction to my profile, key skills, and a brief summary of my background and motivations.

Projects : An animated section featuring all my projects, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to repositories or live demos.

Contact : Three links integrated into the Footer, allowing visitors to reach out to me directly.

Smooth Navigation : Leveraging Next.js routing for quick navigation across different sections of the application.
